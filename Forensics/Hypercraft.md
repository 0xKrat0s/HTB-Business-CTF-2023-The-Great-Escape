We start off this challenge with a simple email file:

However, something jumped out at me. There is an attachment with a double extension, `.pdf.html` with a large Base64 blob.

DISCLAIMER: _The following few steps are a bit dangerous if you don't know what you are doing or are doing it in an insecured environment as it involves some dynamic forensics._

I first saved this HTML file locally:

And hosted it using a python webserver. When accessed, the browser immediately downloads the next stage which is an apparent .zip file.

Indeed it is a zip file which we can decompress and find another stage. Another file with a double extension of .pdf.js.

The javascript file contains a lot of comments/garbage and obfuscated variables.

I cleaned it up a bit by removing the comments and renaming some variables until it made more sense to me and realised what it is doing.

The next stage is concatenating all the parts, then replacing the `s` with nothing, the `V` with nothing and the `sV` with nothing. I did that manually using `sed` and noticed that the resulted blob looked like hex so I hex decoded it using this oneliner:

```bash
cat stage4|sed 's/s//g'|sed 's/V//g'|sed 's/sV//g'|xxd -r -p > stage5
```

This stage has a lot of variables. By a lot, I mean a lot.

Thanks to the preview window in Sublime, I noticed some larger blobs which turns out are base64 blobs that are concatenated.

I put them all together and decoded them in Cyberchef to find a Powershell command execution.

It was piping everything to IEX to detonate so I replaced IEX with a harmless `echo` and ran it which revealed yet another stage. I lost track of stages at this point.

I stared at this code for a while trying to understand it. A closer look shows that it is doing some XOR operations on some HEX bytes:

Realising this I took each byte array, unhexed it and XORed it with the specified Decimal using Cyberchef until I found the one hiding the flag:

Flag: ```HTB{l0ts_of_l4Y3rs_iN_th4t_1}```
